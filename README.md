# AML Alert Suppression System - Management Documentation

## Executive Summary

The AML Alert Suppression System is an automated solution designed to reduce analyst workload by intelligently suppressing repetitive false positive alerts while maintaining compliance standards. The system has been enhanced with stricter criteria to ensure only truly repetitive cases are suppressed.

---

## Business Logic & Criteria

### Suppression Qualification Criteria (ALL 4 Must Be Met):
1. **Historical Pattern**: Entity must have at least 2 closed cases with closure dates
2. **False Positive Status**: The last 2 closed cases (by date) must both be marked as 'Closed FP'
3. **Manual Investigation**: Both cases must have been closed with reason 'manual_investigation' 
4. **Recent Activity**: Both closure dates must be after February 14th, 2025 *(New Requirement)*
5. **Different Dates**: The two cases must have been closed on different dates

### Suppression Period:
- **Duration**: 60 days from the most recent closure date
- **Scope**: All open cases for the qualifying entity are suppressed
- **New Cases**: Any new cases created during suppression period are automatically suppressed
