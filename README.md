Hi [CEO Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

Weekly Progress Update: Agentic AI Application

1. Key Stakeholder Discussions

Saransh: Provided an in-depth walkthrough of our transaction tables and highlighted the critical fields for our use case.

Priyanka & Sonali: Confirmed that the pipeline’s trigger should originate from Freshdesk ticket creation, shifting our focus toward tightly integrating with a ticketing platform.

Vinay: Added context on downstream reporting requirements, ensuring our design aligns with the final deliverables.

2. Freshdesk Integration Feasibility

Freshdesk-triggered workflows will enhance real-time responsiveness and reduce manual effort.

Today, I’ll consult with Biju to assess API availability, authentication requirements, and expected latency for Freshdesk event hooks.

3. API vs. Direct Database Queries

While reviewing our internal API documentation, I identified the “View a Transaction” endpoint, which returns all necessary transaction details in a single call.

If we can leverage this API reliably, we can replace complex SQL queries and reduce maintenance overhead.

I’ll verify with Biju whether this endpoint meets performance and security criteria.

4. Plan for This Week

Evaluate Freshdesk integration:

Confirm API capabilities (ticket creation webhook, error-code handling, rate limits).

Prototype a proof-of-concept with dummy data to validate end-to-end flow.

Validate “View a Transaction” API:

Benchmark response times on sample data.

Compare accuracy and completeness against our existing SQL queries.

Finalize Architecture Decision:

If Freshdesk/API integration meets our SLA targets, proceed with API-first approach.

Otherwise, fall back to the originally planned SQL-based agentic pipeline.

5. Technical Blockers

Latency Estimation: Using dummy CSV data for early prototyping makes it difficult to gauge real-world API response times.

LLM API Usage: Pending clarity on external LLM API access and rate-limit policies—once finalized, this will allow us to benchmark end-to-end inference speed.

Please let me know if you’d like additional detail on any point. I’ll keep you posted on Freshdesk feasibility and API benchmarking by mid-week.

Thank you,
Sourav Dhar
